    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>SlipPay is a receipt marketplace where you can buy and sell cash-based receipts. We connect with your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shoeboxed.com/">Shoeboxed</a> account&mdash;a smart receipt manager that you can download for a smartphone, or access on the web. Once you connect your account, we anonymously posts your receipts in the marketplace for 30 days.</p>
    <p>Buyers can use the <strong>receipt search</strong> (coming soon!) to find what they need, and we connect the buyer-to-seller.</p>

    <h4>Who Uses It</h4>
    <p>A buyer owns an item from a local store, but either threw out their receipt, or their return policy window has passed. A seller paid cash for their item, and is happy to sell their receipt, enabling the buyer to return their item for the full amount. Simple, right?</p>
