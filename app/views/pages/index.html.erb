    <h4>What is SlipPay?</h4>
    <p>SlipPay connects a buyer and seller. The buyer owns a recently purchased good from a local store, but either threw out their receipt, or their return policy window has passed. The seller paid cash for their item, and is happy to sell their receipt, so the buyer can return their good for the full amount.</p>
    <p>Let's face it, sometimes we know we are going to keep something. If you could walk out of a store and sell that receipt in your hand (instead of throwing it out), wouldn't that be great? Now you can.</p>

    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>It's free, and it's open. SlipPay constantly searches through your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shoeboxed.com/">Shoeboxed</a> account for relevant receipts, and anonymously posts them in the marketplace for 30 days. If a buyer is interested, we make sure you both get in touch.</p>
